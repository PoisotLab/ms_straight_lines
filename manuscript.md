# Introduction

The L/S relationship is a fundamental one for food webs ecology

- Early predictions differ in whether this is a linear of exponential relationship
- General case is $L = aS^b$, which is easy to fit
- Has consequences for spatial scaling (Brose)
- Parameters are difficult to reason about ecologically

We know that there are hard boundaries to this system

- Cannot have more than $S^2$ interactions
- Cannot have fewer than $S-1$
- This was not used in the previous attempts to fit the relationship

We know that interactions can be viewed as stochastic events

- Interaction is the outcome of a Bernoulli process
- This lends itself to powerful approaches in probabilistic programming

In this paper

- New relationship between L and S
- Discuss how it changes network prediction
- Use it as a story telling device for a broader point about using our knowledge of the system in creative ways

# Deriving the model

As identified by **MARTINEZ92**, the number of links $L$ in a food web with $S$ nodes can be no lower than $S-1$, and no higher than $S^2$
