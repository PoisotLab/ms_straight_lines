# Introduction

The L/S relationship is a fundamental one for food webs ecology
- Early predictions differ in whether this is a linear of exponential relationship
- General case is $L = aS^b$, which is easy to fit
- Has consequences for spatial scaling (Brose)
- Parameters are difficult to reason about ecologically

We know that there are hard boundaries to this system
- Cannot have more than $S^2$ interactions
- Cannot have fewer than $S-1$
- This was not used in the previous attempts to fit the relationship

We know that interactions can be viewed as stochastic events
- Interaction is the outcome of a Bernoulli process
- This lends itself to powerful approaches in probabilistic programming

In this paper
- New relationship between L and S
- Discuss how it changes network prediction
- Use it as a story telling device for a broader point about using our knowledge of the system in creative ways
