Here, we use a new generation of data and theory to examine long‐standing questions about trophic‐level limits and degrees of omnivory. The data include food webs of the Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A., the island of Saint Martin, a U.K. grassland, and a Florida seagrass community, which appear to be the most trophically complete food webs available in the primary literature due to their inclusion of autotrophs and empirically derived estimates of the relative energetic contributions of each trophic link. We show that most (54%) of the 212 species in the four food webs can be unambiguously assigned to a discrete trophic level. Omnivory among the remaining species appears to be quite limited, as judged by the standard deviation of omnivores’ energy‐weighted food‐chain lengths. This allows simple algorithms based on binary food webs without energetic details to yield surprisingly accurate estimates of species’ trophic and omnivory levels. While maximum trophic levels may plausibly exceed historically asserted limits, our analyses contradict both recent empirical claims that these limits are exceeded and recent theoretical claims that rampant omnivory eliminates the scientific utility of the trophic‐level concept.","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/381964","DOI":"10.1086/381964","ISSN":"0003-0147","title-short":"Limits to Trophic Levels and Omnivory in Complex Food Webs","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Neo D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,3,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,8]]},"container-title-short":"The American Naturalist"},

Its contributing chapter authors treat the ecology of predator-prey interactions and food web theory, structure, and dynamics, joining researchers who also work on complex systems and on large nonlinear networks from the points of view of other sub-fields within ecology. Food webs play a central role in the debates on the role of complexity in stability, persistence, and resilience. Better empirical data and the exploding interest in the subject of networks across social, physical, and natural sciences prompted creation of this volume. The book explores the boundaries of what is known of the relationship between structure and dynamics in ecological networks and defines directions for future developments in this field.","ISBN":"978-0-19-518816-5","title-short":"Ecological Networks","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Pascual","given":"Mercedes"},{"family":"Dunne","given":"Jennifer A."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006]]}},
