  {"id":"Chag15","abstract":"Species interact in nature to form complex ecological networks. There has been a rising interest in recent years to characterize the topology of such networks along various gradients (e.g. successional, climatic, elevational) to better understand how they assemble in space and time. However, to compare structure of networks that vary in size, shape and connectance, topological metrics need to be standardized (as most metrics covary with such network attributes). Traditionally, this has been done by transforming network metrics into z-scores prior comparisons. Here, I show that such standardized metrics are not independent of basic network properties such as connectance. Instead, I found that there was a consistent tendency for z-scores to approach 0 when connectance progressively decreased and approached its minimal value. This is probably due to the reduced null space available for null models to randomize interactions at such low connectance. I discuss ways to circumvent the problem in future studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Chagnon","given":"Pierre-Luc"}],"container-title":"Ecological Complexity","container-title-short":"Ecological Complexity","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecocom.2015.01.004","ISSN":"1476-945X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"36-39","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Characterizing topology of ecological networks along gradients: The limits of metrics’ standardization","title-short":"Characterizing topology of ecological networks along gradients","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476945X15000070","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"CoheNewm85","abstract":"Three recently discovered quantitative empirical generalizations describe major features of the structure of community food webs. These generalizations are: (i) a species scaling law: the mean proportions of basal, intermediate and top species remain invariant at approximately 0.19, 0.53, and 0.29, respectively, over the range of variation in the number of species in a web; (ii) a link scaling law : the mean proportions of trophic links in the categories basal-intermediate, basal-top, intermediate–intermediate, and intermediate–top remain invariant at approximately 0.27, 0.08, 0.30 and 0.35, respectively, over the range of variation in the number of species in a web; and (iii) a link-species scaling law: the ratio of mean trophic links to species remains invariant at approximately 1.86, over the range of variation in the number of species in a web. This paper presents a model, the only successful one among several attempts, in which the first two of these empirical generalizations can be derived as a consequence of the third. The model assumes that species are ordered in a cascade or hierarchy such that a given species can prey on only those species below it and can be preyed on by only those species above it in the hierarchy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"Joel E."},{"family":"Newman","given":"Charles M."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

  {"id":"DoumWeed19","abstract":"Abstract Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions. A major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of >2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression. Beta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Douma","given":"Jacob C."},{"family":"Weedon","given":"James T."}],"container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.13234","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,1]]},"page":"1412-1430","source":"besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","title":"Analysing continuous proportions in ecology and evolution: A practical introduction to beta and Dirichlet regression","title-short":"Analysing continuous proportions in ecology and evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13234","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"DunnWill02a","abstract":"Networks from a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems have been recently described as “small-world” and “scale-free.” However, studies disagree whether ecological networks called food webs possess the characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions required for membership in these classes of networks. Our analysis suggests that the disagreements are based on selective use of relatively few food webs, as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25–172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that although some food webs have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal functional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power–law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Dunne","given":"Jennifer A."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Neo D."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.192407699","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[[2002,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"12917-12922","PMID":"12235364","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Food-web structure and network theory: The role of connectance and size","title-short":"Food-web structure and network theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/99/20/12917","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"VieiAlme15","abstract":"Understanding and predicting species extinctions and coextinctions is a major goal of ecological research in the face of a biodiversity crisis. Typically, models based on network topology are used to simulate coextinctions in mutualistic networks. However, such topological models neglect two key biological features of species interactions: variation in the intrinsic dependence of species on the mutualism, and variation in the relative importance of each interacting partner. By incorporating both types of variation, we developed a stochastic coextinction model capable of simulating extinction cascades far more complex than those observed in previous topological models. Using a set of empirical mutualistic networks, we show that the traditional topological model may either underestimate or overestimate the number and likelihood of coextinctions, depending on the intrinsic dependence of species on the mutualism. More importantly, contrary to topological models, our stochastic model predicts extinction cascades to be more likely in highly connected mutualistic communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Vieira","given":"Marcos Costa"},{"family":"Almeida‐Neto","given":"Mário"}],"container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12394","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"language":"en","page":"144-152","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A simple stochastic model for complex coextinctions in mutualistic networks: robustness decreases with connectance","title-short":"A simple stochastic model for complex coextinctions in mutualistic networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.12394","volume":"18"},

Here, we use a new generation of data and theory to examine long‐standing questions about trophic‐level limits and degrees of omnivory. The data include food webs of the Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A., the island of Saint Martin, a U.K. grassland, and a Florida seagrass community, which appear to be the most trophically complete food webs available in the primary literature due to their inclusion of autotrophs and empirically derived estimates of the relative energetic contributions of each trophic link. We show that most (54%) of the 212 species in the four food webs can be unambiguously assigned to a discrete trophic level. Omnivory among the remaining species appears to be quite limited, as judged by the standard deviation of omnivores’ energy‐weighted food‐chain lengths. This allows simple algorithms based on binary food webs without energetic details to yield surprisingly accurate estimates of species’ trophic and omnivory levels. While maximum trophic levels may plausibly exceed historically asserted limits, our analyses contradict both recent empirical claims that these limits are exceeded and recent theoretical claims that rampant omnivory eliminates the scientific utility of the trophic‐level concept.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Neo D."}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/381964","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,3,1]]},"page":"458-468","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Limits to Trophic Levels and Omnivory in Complex Food Webs: Theory and Data.","title-short":"Limits to Trophic Levels and Omnivory in Complex Food Webs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/381964","volume":"163"}
